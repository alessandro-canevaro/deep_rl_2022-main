# Deep learning project: Reinforcement learning

This repository will function as a file/codedump for the VPN code I showed in the video and possibly other stuff. The code here is as-is. You don't have to use it, and perhaps using it will make the project harder. Please see the videos (video 12) where I discuss the code. If I included my wandb key by accident, please don't abuse it :-).

I don't have many options to contact groups about updates, so I plan to use discord and possibly this repo for that. 

## Practical
 - **Please register your project here**: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12e8qLbGvFx44d0oLgj4e8hoeV8McWBLWg7pK-1fLdCg/edit?usp=sharing **
 - Project description here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ChgaSyp1QnZfhBaXc6Bna248UmY43o7wVpFI9FL6U5M/edit
 - Discord here: https://discord.gg/dCYTJsyUCf

I made a series of videos here about my project proposal. They may also be useful if you are doing general actor-critic stuff, although you can probably find better videos online -- it is basically me talking for a couple of hours without a plan or slides. 

Videos can be found here:

 ** BEST OF LUCK **
